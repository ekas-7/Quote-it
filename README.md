# Project Name: Quote It!

## Description:
Quote It! is a simple web application where users can read, create, edit, and delete quotes. It allows users to share inspirational and thought-provoking quotes with others. The application is built using Node.js with the Express.js framework for the backend and EJS for the frontend. It utilizes UUID for generating unique identifiers for each quote and Faker.js for generating fake timestamps. The application follows RESTful routing principles for handling CRUD operations.

3. **View Individual Quote**: Users can view an individual quote along with its details such as username, content, and timestamp.
4. **Edit Quote**: Users can edit an existing quote to update its content.
5. **Delete Quote**: Users can delete a quote if they no longer want it to be available on the platform.
