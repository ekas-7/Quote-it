# Project Name: Quote It!

## Description:
Quote It! is a simple web application where users can read, create, edit, and delete quotes. It allows users to share inspirational and thought-provoking quotes with others. The application is built using Node.js with the Express.js framework for the backend and EJS for the frontend.

3. **View Individual Quote**: Users can view an individual quote along with its details such as username, content, and timestamp.
4. **Edit Quote**: Users can edit an existing quote to update its content.
5. **Delete Quote**: Users can delete a quote if they no longer want it to be available on the platform.
